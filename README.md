# energised.work

Static blog written in Python using the Pelican framework. The theme Flux has been used. Currently hosted on
AWS but am working on moving this to Azure.

## TODO

- Customise Flux to allow for custom CSS and JS
- Complete first blog post on Pumpy
- Fix Posts and Categories links to go to the correct pages

## Notes

- For any updates to the website, the CDN must be purged after uploading the modified files to the storage resource
  - This should make sense to you Dan, you're the one who found this issue and solution
